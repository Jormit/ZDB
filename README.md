## zdb 
zdb is a work in progress debugger for 64 bit elf binaries aiming to provide an experience similar to gdb. At the moment the debugger supports setting breakpoints and stepping, dissassembly with function and string info (via capstone) and showing the stack and the registers. Elf parsing extended on code from https://github.com/TheCodeArtist/elf-parser/blob/master/elf-parser.c to add .plt and .got address resolution.

## How to use.
This is only for linux and you must have capstone installed on your computer. See http://www.capstone-engine.org/. </br>
To compile run `make`. </br></br>
These are the currently supported commands.
```
Commands:
r              - starts/restarts execution.
c              - continues execution until end or breakpoint.
b [addr/func]  - sets break at specified address.
breaks         - shows set breakpoints.
stack [amount] - displays stackdump of [amount] length.
regs           - displays register values.
sect           - displays elf sections.
func           - displays binary functions with plt and got addresses for dynamic ones.
disas [func]   - displays disassembly of specified function.
q              - quits program.
help           - shows this screen.
```
## TODO
- Add arrows to show branches of jump instructions (like radare2).
- Parsing instructions to extract variables.
- Automatically show info on break.
- Print status of cpu flags.
- Inspect data function.
- Deletion of breakpoints.
- Write mode (session only and to disk).
- Editing registers during running.
- Raw hex dumps.
- Refactoring for extensibility.
- 32 bit.
- Cleaner commands.
- Disas at any address (only function names atm).
- Switch disas mode between memory and disk (So code that decrypts itself can be analysed.).
- Arbitarily control excecution location.
